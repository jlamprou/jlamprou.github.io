The AI community has long believed that bigger models inevitably mean better performance. Our recent work with White-Basilisk challenges this assumption, demonstrating that **architectural innovation** can achieve superior results with significantly fewer parameters.

## The Scaling Paradigm

Traditional thinking suggests that model performance scales predictably with:
- Parameter count
- Training data size  
- Computational resources

While this has held true for many applications, it doesn't tell the complete story.

## Beyond Parameter Count

Our research reveals several key insights:

### Efficiency Through Design
- **Mixture-of-Experts**: Selectively activate model components
- **Linear Attention**: Reduce quadratic complexity
- **Mamba Layers**: Efficient sequence modeling

### Quality Over Quantity
With just **200M parameters**, White-Basilisk outperforms models 5-10x larger in vulnerability detection tasks. This demonstrates that:

1. **Architecture matters more than size** for specific domains
2. **Specialization** can beat generalization in targeted applications
3. **Efficiency** enables practical deployment

## Implications for Research

This shift has profound implications:

- **Sustainable AI**: Reduced computational requirements
- **Democratization**: Lower barriers to entry
- **Innovation Focus**: Architecture over brute force scaling

## Looking Forward

The future of AI lies not just in building bigger models, but in building **smarter ones**. By focusing on architectural innovation, we can achieve breakthrough performance while maintaining practical deployability.

The question isn't "How big can we make it?" but rather "How efficiently can we solve the problem?"
