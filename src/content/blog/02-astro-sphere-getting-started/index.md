During global crises, social media platforms become battlegrounds for information warfare. Our research analyzing **9 million user accounts** during the Russo-Ukrainian War reveals critical insights about automated detection of malicious actors.

## The Challenge

Crisis periods present unique challenges for bot detection:

### Information Overload
- **Volume**: Millions of posts per hour
- **Velocity**: Real-time detection requirements
- **Variety**: Multiple languages and cultural contexts

### Adversarial Adaptation
Malicious actors rapidly evolve their tactics:
- Mimicking legitimate user behavior
- Exploiting trending topics
- Coordinating across networks

## Our Approach

### Dataset Scale
- **9M total users** analyzed
- **343K confirmed bot accounts**
- **Multilingual coverage** across conflict discourse

### Methodology Innovation
We developed **BotArtist**, achieving **11% improvement** over existing solutions:

1. **Suspension-based Training**: Using platform enforcement as ground truth
2. **Behavioral Features**: Beyond content analysis to user patterns  
3. **Temporal Dynamics**: Capturing evolution during crisis periods

## Key Findings

### Exploitation Patterns
Bot networks systematically exploit crisis events:
- **Trending Hijacking**: Injecting malicious content into popular topics
- **Emotional Manipulation**: Targeting heightened emotional states
- **Narrative Distortion**: Spreading false information about critical events

### Detection Insights
- **Behavioral signatures** remain more stable than content patterns
- **Network analysis** reveals coordination better than individual account analysis
- **Real-time adaptation** is crucial for maintaining effectiveness

## Implications

### Platform Governance
Our findings inform better content moderation:
- **Proactive Detection**: Identifying threats before they spread
- **Crisis Protocols**: Specialized response during global events
- **Cross-platform Coordination**: Addressing network-wide threats

### Research Directions
- **Adversarial Robustness**: Building detection systems that adapt
- **Explainable AI**: Understanding why accounts are flagged
- **Privacy-Preserving**: Protecting legitimate users while catching bad actors

## Lessons Learned

1. **Context Matters**: Crisis periods require specialized detection approaches
2. **Scale is Essential**: Large datasets enable robust model training
3. **Adaptation is Key**: Static models fail against evolving threats

The battle against coordinated inauthentic behavior is ongoing, but with the right tools and approaches, we can maintain information integrity even during the most challenging global events.
